General Roadmap

- [X] Finish lengthLexCompare
- [X] Write constructor(s) for vertex and edges
- [X] Write constructor for paths
- [ ] Printing function for a path (and vertex/edge) (as well as  - two versions: one just prints ids of edges/vertices, one that uses the labels
- [ ] Decide how to/implement storage of the adjacency matrix of the graph.
- [ ] Get the constructor(s) for PathAlgebra working - in particular decide how to read in the adjacency matrix of a graph, store vertex labels, edge labels
- [ ] Write the path multiplication code - should be several cases depending on whether the left/right path is a vertex or not.
- [ ] Implement adding/looking up paths to the path table (think about when to actually add paths to the table)
- [ ] Write a version of path multiplication that performs the lookup as well.
- [ ] Define function which creates a PAElement out of a path.
- [ ] Define function which takes a list of indices and a list of coefficients and creates a PAElement
- [ ] Implement arithmetic on PAElements (add, subtract, multiply)
